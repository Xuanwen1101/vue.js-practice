[Problem J1: Boiling Water](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2021/ccc/juniorEF.pdf)
### Problem Description
At sea level, atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa and water begins to boil at 100 ℃. <br/>
As you go above sea level, atmospheric pressure decreases, and water boils at lower temperatures. As you go below sea level, atmospheric pressure increases, and water boils at higher temperatures. A formula relating atmospheric pressure to the temperature at which water begins to boil is
```
P = 5 × B − 400
```
where P is atmospheric pressure measured in kPa, and B is the temperature at which water begins to boil measured in ℃.
Given the temperature at which water begins to boil, determine atmospheric pressure. Also determine if you are below sea level, at sea level, or above sea level.
